GoodMovies
==========

GoodMovies is a python script that allows reading lists of top rated movies from
internet sites (e.g. www.imdb.com) and write the movie names into a text file.

This file then can be used for example as input for MythTV's TVWish addon (see
http://www.templetons.com/brad/myth/tvwish.html).
